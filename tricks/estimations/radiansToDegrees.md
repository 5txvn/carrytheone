# Radians to Degrees
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The conversion from radians to degrees is not exact, and thus, is only used on estimation problems if the value you're given for radians isn't in terms of pi. The exact factor is $\pi\mathrm{rad}=180^{\circ}$, and this evaluates to about 57 degrees per radian.
## Example 1
*Approximately how many degrees are in 6.5 radians?*
1. To do this problem, we simply have to evaluate $57\times 6.5$. However, this math is rather ugly so I'll go ahead and round 57 to 56 for the sake of simplicity to use the double/half trick, giving us $56\times 6.5=28\times 13=366^{\circ}$
2. Final Answer: **366**
## Example 2
*How many degrees are in $\frac{3\pi}4$ radians?*
1. Since we're given the radians in terms of pi, we can solve for the exact degree measure using $1\mathrm{rad}=\frac{180}{\pi}^{\circ}$, so $\frac{3\pi}4\times\frac{180}{\pi}^{\circ}=180^{\circ}\times\frac 34=135^{\circ}$
2. Final Answer: **135**
