# Estimating Powers of E
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
On Number Sense tests, you might also see estimation problems that look something similar to $e^6\approx ?$. To do these problems, we can estimate $e^3$ as 20. Since we might have to sometimes estimate powers of e that aren't multiples of 3, we can also assume $e\approx 2.7$ and $e^2\approx 7.3$ to break up those higher powers.
## Example 1
$$e^6\approx$$
1. $e^6$ can be re-expressed as $(e^3)^2$. Since we estimate $e^3$ as 20, then our answer is just $(e^3)^2=(20)^2=400$
2. Final Answer: **400**
## Example 2
$$e^5\approx$$
1. $e^5$ can be re-expressed as $e^2e^3$. Again, since we estimate $e^3$ as 20 and $e^2$ as 7.3, our final answer is $e^2e^3=7.3(20)=146$
2. Final Answer: **146**
