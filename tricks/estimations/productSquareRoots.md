# Estimating Products of Square Roots
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
This problem type follows the format of estimating $\sqrt a\times\sqrt b$, where a and b are too numbers that are relatively close to one another (say, within 10% of each other). In this case, using ideas from the center trick, we can estimate the product of these square roots to simply be their mean (in other words, $\frac{a+b}2$).
## Example 1
$$\sqrt{700}\times\sqrt{750}$$
1. Since 700 and 750 are relatively close to one another, we can estimate the product of these square roots to be $\frac{700+750}2=725$
2. Final Answer: **725**
## Example 2
$$\sqrt{453}\times\sqrt{478}$$
1. For starters, lets estimate this problem to be $\sqrt{450}\times\sqrt{480}$ to deal with nicer numbers. Since 450 and 480 are close to one another, again, we can estimate the product of these square roots to be $\frac{450+480}2=465$.
2. Final Answer: **465**
## Video Explanation(s)
