## General Explanation
Most times, when you see a multiplication problem on general math, it can be quite easily estimated using fractions. Refer to the following common fractions and problems for examples:
+ $\frac 13=0.333\dots$
+ $\frac 14=0.25$
+ $\frac 15=0.2$
+ $\frac 16=0.166\dots$
+ $\frac 17=0.142\dots$
+ $\frac 18=0.125$
+ $\frac 19=0.111\dots$
+ $\frac 1{11}=0.0909\dots$
+ $\frac 1{12}=0.0833\dots$
+ $\frac 1{16}=0.0625$
## Example 1
$$537\times 671=$$
1. Using our common fractions, we can recognize that 671 is very close to $666.666\dots=1000\times\frac 23$. We can also round 537 to 540, and thus, we can estimate as $537\times 671$ as $540\times\frac 23\times 1000=360000$
2. Final Answer: **360000**
## Example 2
$$285\times 1388$$
1. This one's a bit harder to spot, but our common fractions tells us that 285 looks very close to $1000\times\frac 27$. We can also round 1388 to 1400, and thus, we can estimate $285\times 1388$ as $1400\times\frac 27\times 1000=400000$
2. Final Answer: **400000**
