# Estimating Powers of Pi
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
On Number Sense tests, you might see estimation problems that look something similar to $\pi^6\approx ?$. To do these problems, you can typically estimate $\pi^2$ to be 10 (the actual value is 9.87), and estimate $\pi$ as 3.1. To estimate higher powers, just break up the higher power into groups of $\pi^2$ and $\pi$.
## Example 1
$$\pi^4\approx$$
1. $\pi^4$ can be re-expressed as $(\pi^2)^2$. Since we estimate $\pi^2$ as 10, then our answer is just $(\pi^2)^2\approx 10^2=100$
2. Final Answer: **100**
## Example 2
$$\pi^7\approx$$
1. $\pi^7$ can be re-expressed as $\pi(\pi^2)^3$. Again, since we estimate $\pi^2$ as 10 and $\pi$ as 3.1, our final answer is $\pi(\pi^2)^3=3.1(10)^3=3100$
2. Final Answer: **3100**
