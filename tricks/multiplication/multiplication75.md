# Multiplication by 75
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
This trick is quite similar to both the multiplying by 25 and 50 tricks, with one notable difference being that you don't always immediately write the whole number result of your division in the answer blank. For this trick, we take advantage of the fact that $75=\frac{300}4$

1. Take the number you are multiplying and divide it by 4 (keep result in remainder form).
2. Multiply the whole number portion of your result by 3. Take your remainder, and refer to the value in the added column that corresponds to your remainder. Add this number to this result and write the new result down.
3. Using the following table, write the remaining two digits to the left of the current answer using the remainder of your division.

| Remainder | Digits | Added |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| 0         | 00     | 0     |
| 1         | 75     | 0     |
| 2         | 50     | 1     |
| 3         | 25     | 2     |
## Example 1
$$33\times 75=$$
1. First, divide 33 by 4 to get $33\div 4=8\mathrm r1$.
2. Multiply 8 by 3 ($8\times 3=24$). Since the "added" value that correlates with a remainder of 1 is 0, we do not have to add anything to the 24 and can simply write it in the answer blank (**24**).
3. According to the table, our remainder of 1 corresponds with the digits 75, so write these digits after the 24 (**2475**).
4. Final answer: **2475**
## Example 2
$$43\times 75=$$
1. First, divide 43 by 4 to get $43\div 4=10\mathrm r3$.
2. Multiply 10 by 3 ($10\times 3=30$). The "added" value that correlates with a remainder of 3 is 2, so add 2 to 30 ($30+2=32$). Write 32 in the answer blank (**32**).
3. According to the table, our remainder of 3 corresponds with the digits 25, so write these digits after the 32 (**3225**).
4. Final answer: **3225**
