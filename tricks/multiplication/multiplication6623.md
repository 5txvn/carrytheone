# Multiplication by $66\frac 23$
## Notes
+ Number must be divisible by 3
## General Explanation
Beyond the decimal forms of $16\frac 23$ and $33\frac 13$, we can recognize that $66\frac 2/3=66.666\dots=100\times\frac 23$. Thus, we can multiply any number divisible by 3 by $66\frac 23$ by doing the following:<br>
1. Divide the number by 3
2. Multiply by 2, and write this result down
2. Add two 0s at the end
## Example 1
$$33\times 66\frac 23=$$
1. $33\div 3=11$
2. $11\times 2=22$ (**22**)
3. Add two 0s at the end of the 22 (**2200**)
4. Final Answer: **2200**
## Example 2
$$48\times 66\frac 23=$$
1. $48\div 3=16$
2. $16\times 2=32$ (**32**)
3. Add two 0s at the end of 32 (**3200**)
4. Final Answer: **3200**
## Video Explanation(s)
