# Multiplication by 11
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
+ Carrying required
## General Explanation
This trick is one of the most basic in Number Sense and can be easily accomodated to any number of digits. The process is as follows:
1. Write down the last digit of the number on the right side of the answer blank
2. Move to the next digit on the left, and add the previous digit. Write this number to the left of the current answer. Carry if needed.
3. Continue this process until there are no more digits on the left. At this point, simply write down the first digit on the left side of the current answer.

You can essentially think of this process as sliding across the number from right to left in groups of 2, adding those groups of 2, and writing the result from right to left.
## Example 1
$$52\times 11=$$
1. Write down the last digit (2) on the right side of the answer blank (**2**)
2. Move to the next digit (5), and add the previous digit ($2+5=7$). Write this number to the left of the 2 (**72**)
3. There are no digits to the left of 5, so simply write down 5 to the left of the 72 (**572**)
4. Final Answer: **572**
## Example 2
$$68\times 11=$$
1. Write down the last digit (8) on the right side (**8**)
2. Move to the next digit (6), and add the previous digit ($6+8=14$). Write down the 4 to the left of the 8, and carry the 1 (**48**)
3. There are no digits to the left of 6, so add the carry to the 6 ($6+1=7$) and write down this 7 to the left of the 48 (**748**)
4. Final answer: **748**
## Example 3
$$583\times 11=$$
1. Write down the last digit (3) on the right side (**3**)
2. Move to the next digit (8), and add the previous digit ($8+3=11$). Write down the 1 to the left of the 3, and carry the other 1 (**13**)
3. Move to the next digit (5), and add the previous digit ($8+5=13$). Also, add the carry ($13+1=14$). Write down 4 to the left of the 13, and carry the 1 (**413**)
4. There are no digits to the left of 5, so add the carry to the 5 ($5+1=6$) and write down this 6 to the left of the 413 (**6413**)
5. Final answer: **6413**
