# 3-digit FOIL
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
+ Carrying required
## General Explanation
This trick is used for multiplying two three-digit numbers mentally and is quite similar to 2-digit FOIL. If you have not yet read that trick, please do so to understand the following steps:

1. Multiply the last two digits of the two numbers. Write this number to the right of the answer blank, and carry if needed.
2. Multiply the middle digit of the first number and the last digit of the second number. Then, multiply the last digit of the first number and the middle digit of the second number. Add these two results together, write this number to the left of the current answer, and carry if needed.
3. Multiply the first digit of the first number with the last digit of the second number, the middle digits of both numbers, and the last digit of the first number with the first digit of the second number. Add these three results together, write this number to the left of the current answer, and carry if needed.
4. Multiply the first digit of the first number with the middle digit of the second number. Multiply the middle digit of the first number with the first digit of the second number. Add these two results together, write this number to the left of the current answer, and carry if needed.
5. Multiply the first digits of the two numbers. Write this number to the left of the current answer.

## Example 1
$$123\times 456=$$
1. Multiply the last two digits together ($3\times 6=18$). Write the 8 on the right, carry the 1 (**1**).
2. Then, multiply $2\times 6=12$ and $3\times 5=15$. Add these two ($12+15=27$), and add the carry ($27+1=28$). Write the 8 to the left, and carry the 2 (**81**).
3. Then, multiply $1\times 6=6$, $2\times 5=10$, and $3\times 4=12$. Add these three results ($6+10+12=28$), and add the carry ($28+2=30$). Write the 0 to the left, and carry the 3 (**081**).
4. Multiply $1\times 5=5$ and $2\times 4=8$. Add these two ($5+8=13$), and add the carry ($13+3=16$). Write the 6 to the left, and carry the 1 (**6081**).
5. Multiply the first two digits of the numbers together ($1\times 4=4$), and add the carry ($4+1=5$). Write this number to the left (**56081**).
6. Final answer: **56081**

## Example 2
$$892\times 193=$$
1. Multiply the last two digits together ($2\times 3=6$). Write the 6 on the right (**6**).
2. Then, multiply $9\times 3=27$ and $2\times 9=18$. Add these two ($27+18=45$). Write the 5 to the left, and carry the 4 (**56**).
3. Then, multiply $8\times 3=24$, $9\times 9=81$, and $2\times 1=2$. Add these three results ($24+81+2=107$), and add the carry ($107+4=111$). Write the 1 to the left, and carry the 11 (**156**).
4. Multiply $8\times 9=72$ and $9\times 1=9$. Add these two ($72+9=81$), and add the carry ($81+11=92$). Write the 2 to the left, and carry the 9 (**2156**).
5. Multiply the first two digits of the numbers together ($8\times 1=8$), and add the carry ($8+9=17$). Write this number to the left (**172156**).
6. Final answer: **172156**
