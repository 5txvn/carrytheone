# Multiplication by 12
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
+ Carrying required
## General Explanation
This trick's a bit more advanced than multiplying by 11, so rely more on the examples to guide your intuition:
1. Take the last digit and multiply it by 2. Write this result on the right side of the answer blank. Carry if needed.
2. Move left to the next digit. Multiply it by 2, and add the previous digit. Write this result on the left side of the current answer. Carry if needed.
3. Continue this process until you reach the first digit. Once you do, simply write it down to the left of the current answer.
## Example 1
$$52\times 12=$$
1. Take the last digit (2) and multiply it by 2 ($2\times 2=4$). Write this down on the right side of the answer blank (**4**)
2. Move to the next digit (5). Multiply it by 2 and add the previous digit ($5\times 2+2=12$). Write down 2 to the left of 4, and carry the 1 (**24**)
3. We've reached the first digit, so add the carry ($5+1=6$), and write the 6 to the left of the 24 (**624**)
4. Final Answer: **624**
## Example 2
$$386\times 12=$$
1. Take the last digit (6) and multiply it by 2 ($6\times 2=12$). Write 2 down on the right side of the answer blank and carry the 1 (**2**)
2. Move to the next digit (8), multiply it by 2, and add the previous digit as well as the carry ($8\times 2+6+1=23$). Write 3 down to the left of the 2 and carry the 2 (**32**)
3. Move to the next digit (3), multiply it by 2, and add the previous digit as well as the carry ($3\times 2+8+2=16$). Write 6 down to the left of the 32 and carry the 1 (**632**)
4. We've reached the first digit, so add the carry ($3+1=4$), and write down the 4 to the left of the 632 (**4632**)
5. Final Answer: **4632**
