# Multiplication by 15
## Notes
+ Multiple Cases
## General Explanation
This trick can essentially be split into two cases, the first being that the number you are multiplying is even, and the second being that it is odd. Regardless, we will be leveraging the fact that $15=\frac{30}2$ for this trick.<br><br>
Process for **even** numbers:
1. Divide the number by 2
2. Multiply the result by 3 and write it down
3. Add a 0 at the end

Process for **odd** numbers:
1. Subtract 1 from the number and THEN divide it by 2
2. Multiply the result by 30
3. Add 15 to the new result, and write down this answer
## Example 1
$$46\times 15=$$
1. Divide 46 by 2 ($46\div 2=23$)
2. Multiply the result by 3 ($23\times 3=69$)
3. Add a zero at the end (**690**)
4. Final answer: **690**

## Example 2
$$35\times 15$$
1. Subtract 1 from 35 ($35-1=34$) and divide that result by 2 ($34\div 2=17$)
2. Multiply that result by 30 ($17\times 30=510$)
3. Add 15 ($510+15=525$), and write down this as your answer (**525**)
4. Final answer **525**
