# Multiplication by 25
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
To multiply any number by 25, we take advantage of the fact that $25=\frac{100}4$.
1. Take the number you are multiplying and divide it by 4 (keep result in remainder form).
2. Write the whole number part of your answer in the answer blank.
3. Using the following table, write the remaining two digits to the left of the current answer using the remainder of your division by 4.

| Remainder | Digits |
| --------- | ------ |
| 0         | 00     |
| 1         | 25     |
| 2         | 50     |
| 3         | 75     |
## Example 1
$$27\times 25=$$
1. First, divide 27 by 4 to get $27\div 4=6\mathrm r3$. Write the 6 in the answer blank (**6**).
2. According to the table, our remainder of 3 corresponds with the digits 75, so write these digits after the 6 (**675**).
3. Final answer: **675**
## Example 2
$$54\times 25=$$
1. First, divide 54 by 4 to get $54\div 4=13\mathrm r2$. Write the 13 in the answer blank (**13**).
2. According to the table, our remainder of 2 corresponds with the digits 50, so write these digits after the 13 (**1350**).
3. Final answer: **1350**
