# Multiplication by $33\frac 13$
## Notes
+ Number must be divisible by 3
## General Explanation
In addition to knowing that $16\frac 23=\frac{100}6$, it shouldn't be difficult to also recognize that $33\frac 13=33.333\dots=\frac{100}3$. Thus, we can multiply any number divisible by 3 by $33\frac 13$ by doing the following:<br>
1. Divide the number by 3
2. Multiply by 100
## Example 1
$$36\times 33\frac 13=$$
1. $36\div 3=12$
2. $6\times 100=1200$
3. Final answer: **1200**
## Example 2
$$84\times 33\frac 13=$$
1. $84\div 3=28$
2. $28\times 100=2800$
3. Final answer: **2800**
