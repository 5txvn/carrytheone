# Multiplication by 125
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Similar to the multiplying by 75 trick, you don't always immediately write the whole number result of your division in the answer blank for multiplication by 125, unlike multiplication by 25 or 50. For this trick, we take advantage of the fact that $125=\frac{500}4$

1. Take the number you are multiplying and divide it by 4 (keep result in remainder form).
2. Multiply the whole number portion of your result by 5. Take your remainder, and refer to the value in the added column that corresponds to your remainder. Add this number to this result and write the new result down.
3. Using the following table, write the remaining two digits to the left of the current answer using the remainder of your division.

| Remainder | Digits | Added |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| 0         | 00     | 0     |
| 1         | 25     | 1     |
| 2         | 50     | 2     |
| 3         | 75     | 3     |
## Example 1
$$33\times 125=$$
1. First, divide 33 by 4 to get $33\div 4=8\mathrm r1$.
2. Multiply 8 by 5 ($8\times 5=40$). The "added" value that correlates with a remainder of 1 is 1, so add 1 to 40 ($40+1=41$). Write 41 in the answer blank (**41**).
3. According to the table, our remainder of 1 corresponds with the digits 25, so write these digits after the 41 (**4125**).
4. Final answer: **4125**
## Example 2
$$43\times 125=$$
1. First, divide 43 by 4 to get $43\div 4=10\mathrm r3$.
2. Multiply 10 by 5 ($10\times 5=50$). The "added" value that correlates with a remainder of 3 is 3, so add 3 to 50 ($50+3=53$). Write 53 in the answer blank (**53**).
3. According to the table, our remainder of 3 corresponds with the digits 75, so write these digits after the 53 (**5375**).
4. Final answer: **5375**
