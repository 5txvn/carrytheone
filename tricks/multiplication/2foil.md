# 2-digit FOIL
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
+ Carrying required
## General Explanation
FOIL is a method used in Number Sense to be able to mentally multiply any set of two digit numbers (for example, $34\times 79$). The acronym stands for **F**irst, **O**uter, **I**nner, and **L**ast, but even this acronym is a bit disingenuous. Rather, the order we actually follow when abiding by this trick is LOIF, and the process isn't quite four steps as the name implies, but rather 3 (the outer and inner are part of the same step):<br>
1. Multiply the last two digits of the two numbers. Write this number to the right of the answer blank, and carry if needed.
2. Multiply the outer two digits of the two numbers, and multiply the inner two digits of the two numbers. Add these two results together, write this number to the left of the current answer, and carry if needed.
3. Multiply the first two difits of the two numbers. Write this number to the left of the current answer.

Refer to the following image to understand what I mean by first, outer, inner, and last digits (the image uses polynomials, but the idea is the same):

## Example 1
$$34\times 79=$$
1. Multiply the last two digits together ($4\times 9=36$). Write the 6 on the right, carry the 3 (**6**)
2. Multiply the outer two digits together ($3\times 9=27$) and multiply the inner two digits together ($4\times 7=28$). Add these two ($27+28=55$), and add the carry ($55+3=58$). Write the 8 to the left, carry the 5 (**86**)
3. Multiply the first two digits together ($3\times 7=21$). Add the carry ($21+5=26$), and write down this final result to the left (**2686**)
4. Final answer: **2686**
## Example 2
$$63\times 47=$$
1. Multiply the last two digits together ($3\times 7=21$). Write the 1 on the right, carry the 2 (**1**)
2. Multiply the outer two digits together ($6\times 7=42$) and multiply the inner two digits together ($3\times 4=12$). Add these two ($42+12=54$), and add the carry ($54+2=56$). Write the 6 to the left, carry the 5 (**61**)
3. Multiply the first two digits together ($6\times 4=24$). Add the carry ($24+5=29$), and write down this final result to the left (**2961**)
4. Final answer: **2961**
