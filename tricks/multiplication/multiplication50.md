# Multiplication by 50
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
To multiply any number by 50, we take advantage of the fact that $50=\frac{100}2$.
1. Take the number you are multiplying and divide it by 2 (keep result in remainder form).
2. Write the whole number part of your answer in the answer blank.
3. Using the following table, write the remaining two digits to the left of the current answer using the remainder of your division by 2.

| Remainder | Digits |
| --------- | ------ |
| 0         | 00     |
| 1         | 50     |
## Example 1
$$27\times 50=$$
1. First, divide 27 by 2 to get $27\div 2=13\mathrm r1$. Write the 13 in the answer blank (**13**).
2. According to the table, our remainder of 1 corresponds with the digits 50, so write these digits after the 13 (**1350**).
3. Final answer: **1350**
## Example 2
$$54\times 50=$$
1. First, divide 54 by 2 to get $54\div 2=27\mathrm r0$. Write the 27 in the answer blank (**27**).
2. According to the table, our remainder of 0 corresponds with the digits 00, so write these digits after the 27 (**2700**).
3. Final answer: **2700**
