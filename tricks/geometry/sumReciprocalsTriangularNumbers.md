# Sum of Reciprocals of Triangular Numbers
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Use the formula $\frac{2n}{n+1}$, where n is the nth reciprocal triangular number you're summing.
## Example 1
$$1+\frac 13+\frac 16+\dots+\frac 1{28}=$$
1. $\frac 1{28}$ is the reciprocal of the 7th triangular number, so n=7 and the answer is $\frac{2\times 7}{7+1}=\frac{14}8=\frac 74$
## Example 2
$$\frac 13+\frac 16+\frac 1{10}+\frac 1{55}=$$
1. $\frac 1{55}$ is the reciprocal of the 10th triangular number, so n=10 and we do $\frac{2\times 10}{10+1}=\frac{20}{11}$. Since there is no 1 at the beginning of the summation, we subtract 1 from $\frac{20}{11}$ to get an answer of $\frac 9{11}$
