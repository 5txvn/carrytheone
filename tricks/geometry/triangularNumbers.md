## General Explanation
Mathematically, triangular numbers look something like the following image:

If you're trying to find the nth triangular number, you can think of it as just the sum of all integers up to that point (e.g., the 4th triangular number is simply just $T_4=1+2+3+4=10$). However, we can use the formula $T_n=\frac{n(n+1)}2$ to simplify finding the nth triangular number.
## Example 1
*Find the 7th triangular number.*<br>
To get the 7th triangular number, we can use the formula to get $T_7=\frac{7(7+1)}2=28$.
## Example 2
$$1+2+3+\dots+10=$$
This is the definition of the 10th triangular number, so we can use the formula $T_n=\frac{n(n+1)}2$ to get $T_{10}=\frac{10(10+1)}2=55$.
