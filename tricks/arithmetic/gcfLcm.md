## General Explanation
In math, GCF stands for the greatest common factor and is essentially the largest number that divides into two given numbers. Typically, the GCF can be found rather intuitively when asked for it on a Number Sense test, but the most direct way to solve for it is to find the prime factorization of the two given numbers, and collect all the repeated factors (i.e., $30=2\times 3\times 5$ and $12=2^2\times 3$, so their GCF is $2\times 3=6$). The LCM, or least common multiple, is the smallest number that is a multiple of two given numbers. By the definition of LCM, it can be shown that $\mathrm{LCM}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\mathrm{GCD(a,b)}}$.
## Example 1
*Find the GCF of 48 and 30.*
1. Though this is best done intuitively, let's use the prime factorization method. 48 can be represented as $2^4\times 3^1$ and 30 can be represented $2^1\times 3^1\times 5^1$. If we collect all the common factors across these factorizations, we get $2^1$ and $3^1$, giving us a GCF of $2\times 3=6$.
2. Final Answer: **6**
## Example 2
*Find the LCM of 45 and 27.*
1. The GCF of 45 and 27 is 9.
2. Using the formula $\mathrm{LCM}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\mathrm{GCD(a,b)}}$, we find $\mathrm{LCM}(45,27)=\frac{45\times 27}9=5\times 27=135$.
3. Final Answer: **135**
## Example 3
*Find the product of the GCF and LCM of 18 and 8.*
1. Since $\mathrm{LCM}(18,8)=\frac{18\times 8}{\mathrm{GCD(18,8)}}$, then $\mathrm{LCM}(18,8)\times \mathrm{GCF}(18,8)=18\times 8=144$. In other words, <b>the product of the GCF and LCM of two numbers is always the product of the two numbers themselves</b>.
2. Final Answer: **144**
