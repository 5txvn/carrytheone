# Multiplying Numbers Under 100
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
+ Carrying required
## General Explanation
This trick is used to multiply two numbers just under 100 and is similar to that for two numbers just under 100. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Compute the difference between the numbers and 100. Multiply them to get the last two digits of your final answer, and write them on the right side of the answer blank
2. Subtract these differences from 100. This will give you the first digits of your answer, and carry if needed.
## Example 1
$$92\times 94=$$
1. The differences between these two numbers and 100 are 8 and 6. Multiply them together ($8\times 6=48$) and write the result (**48**)
2. Subtract these differences from 100 ($100-8-6=86$). Write this number to the left of the current answer (**8648**)
3. Final Answer: **8648**
## Example 2
$$87\times 91=$$
1. The differences between these two numbers and 100 are 13 and 9. Multiply them together ($13\times 9=117$), write the 17 on the right side of the answer blank, and carry the 1 (**17**)
2. Subtract these differences from 100 ($100-13-9=78$). Add the carry ($78+1=79$) Write this number to the left of the current answer (**7917**)
3. Final Answer: **7917**
