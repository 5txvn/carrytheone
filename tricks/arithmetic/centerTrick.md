# Center Trick
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The center trick is used to multiply two numbers that are "centered" around another number, typically a multiple of 10 or 5 since they are easy to square (to square multiples of 5, please refer to that trick in this section). These two numbers are also usually close to one another, and to multiply them, complete the following steps:
1. Comupte the square of the center number
2. Compute the square of the difference between the numbers and the center number
3. Subtract this from the square of the center number
## Example 1
$$38\times 42=$$
1. In this case, our center number is 40 and the distance from the center to the other numbers is 2. Square the center number ($40\times 40=1600$)
2. Square the difference ($2\times 2=4$)
3. Subtract this number from the square of the center number ($1600-4=1596$)
4. Final Answer: **1596**
## Example 2
$$71\times 79=$$
1. In this case, our center number is 75 and the distance from the center to the other numbers is 4. Square the center number ($75\times 75=5625$)
2. Square the difference ($4\times 4=16$)
3. Subtract this number from the square of the center number ($5625-16=5609$)
4. Final Answer: **5609**
