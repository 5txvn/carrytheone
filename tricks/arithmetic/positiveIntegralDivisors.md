# Number of Positive Integral Divisors
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
In Number Sense, positive integral divisors is just a super fancy way of referring to the factors of a number. If we are asked to find the number of positive integral divisors a number has, this is as simple as finding the number of factors the number has. This can be done with the following steps:
1. Find the prime factorization of the number.
2. Add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Multiply all these results together.
## Example 1
*How many positive integral divisors does 48 have?*
1. The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4\times 3^1$
2. Add 1 to each of the exponents to get $4+1=5$ and $1+1=2$
3. Multiply all these results together ($5\times 2=10$)
4. Final Answer: **10**
## Example 2
*How many positive integral divisors does 60 have?*
1. The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2\times 3^1\times 5^1$
2. Add 1 to each of the exponents to get $2+1=3$, $1+1=2$, and $1+1=2$
3. Multiply all these results together ($3\times 2\times 2=12$)
4. Final Answer: **12**
