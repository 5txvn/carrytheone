# Number of Positive Integral Divisors
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Please refer to the trick to find the number of positive integral divisors of a number before this trick. The sum of the positive integral divisors can be found using the following steps:
1. Find the prime factorization of the number.
2. Take each base, and add all the exponents of that base preceding the number until you reach 1.
3. Multiply all these results together.
## Example 1
*What is the sum of the positive integral divisors of 48?*
1. The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4\times 3^1$
2. Start with $2^4$ and add all the exponents of 2 that precede $2^4$. This gives us $2^4+2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0=31$
3. Then, take $3^1$ and add all the exponents of 3 that precede $3^1$. This gives us $3^1+3^0=4$
4. Multiply all these results together ($31\times 4=124$)
5. Final Answer: **124**
## Example 2
*What is the sum of the positive integral divisors of 60?*
1. The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2\times 3^1\times 5^1$
2. Start with $2^2$ and add all the exponents of 2 that precede $2^2$. This gives us $2^2+2^1+2^0=7$
3. Then, take $3^1$ and add all the exponents of 3 that precede $3^1$. This gives us $3^1+3^0=4$
4. Lastly, take $5^1$ and add all the exponents of 5 that precede $5^1$. This gives us $5^1+5^0=6$
5. Multiply all these results together ($7\times 4\times 6=168$)
6. Final Answer: **168**
