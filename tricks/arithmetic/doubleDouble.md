## General Explanation
This trick is practically exactly the same as the double/half multiplication trick, except double or half both factors instead of doing one and the other (read the double/half trick first if you don't understand what I'm referring to). Again, this can be generalized with the expression $\frac ab=\frac{ka}{kb}$
## Example 1
$$125\div 2.5=$$
1. Obviously dividing by 2.5 is quite nasty, so it's in our best interest to first multiply it by 2. Thus, using double/double division, we get $125\div 2.5=(125\times 2)\div (2.5\times 2)=250\div 5$
2. After rewriting the problem, simply evaluate the expression ($250\div 5=50$)
3. Final Answer: **50**
## Example 2
$$36\div 0.375=$$
1. Assuming you know your fractions well, we know that $\frac 38=0.375$, so the most logical thing to do for this problem is to multiply both the divisor and dividend by 8 in order to make 0.375 a whole number. Thus, we get $36\div 0.375=(36\times 8)\div (0.375\times 8)=288\div 3$
2. After rewriting the problem, simply evaluate the expression ($288\div 3=96$)
3. Final Answer: **96**
