# Add to Ten Ones Digit
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
## General Explanation
This trick is used to multiply two 2-digit numbers that have the same first digits and have last digits that add to 10:
1. Multiply the last digits by each other. Write this result on the right side of the answer blank.
2. Take the first digit and multiply it by 1 more than itself. Write this result to the left of the current answer.
## Example 1
$$43\times 47=$$
1. Multiply the last two digits ($3\times 7=21$). Write this number on the right side of the blank (**21**)
2. Take the first digit (4) and multiply it by 1 more than itself ($4\times (4+1)=20$). Write this result to the left of the current answer (**2021**)
3. Final Answer: **2021**
## Example 2
$$81\times 89=$$
1. Multiply the last two digits ($1\times 9=09$). Write this number on the right side of the blank (**09**)
2. Take the first digit (8) and multiply it by 1 more than itself ($8\times (8+1)=72$). Write this result to the left of the current answer (**7209**)
3. Final Answer: **7209**
