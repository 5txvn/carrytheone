# Double Half Multiplication
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Sometimes on Number Sense, we might encounter problems that none of the multiplication tricks apply to, and thus, we resort to using FOIL to solve it. However, we can sometimes use the double/half trick to help us with certain multiplication problems (particularly those that involve multiples of 5). Essentially the idea is that some multiplication problems can be made easier if you double one of the numbers you are multiplying and halving the other. This can work with any factor as well (so for example, you can quadruple one of the factors and divide the other by 4 if that makes things easier). This is generalizable with the expression $ab=(ka)\left(\frac bk\right)$
## Example 1
$$12\times 35=$$
1. In this case, we can see that this problem would become very simple if we double 35 to make 70. Thus, using double/half, we get $12\times 35=(12\div 2)(35\times 2)=6\times 70$
2. After rewriting the problem, simply evaluate it using other multiplication tricks/the times table ($6\times 70=420$)
3. Final Answer: **420**
## Example 2
$$17\times 25=$$
1. Obviously it would be best to use the traditional multiplication by 25 trick for this problem, but this is a really neat example of double/half in action. Instead of doubling it, we can quadruple 25 and divide 17 by 4 to get $17\times 25=(17\div 4)(25\times 4)=4.25\times 100$
2. After rewriting the problem, simply evaluate it ($4.25\times 100=425$)
3. Final Answer: **425**
