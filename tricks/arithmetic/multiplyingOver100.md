# Multiplying Numbers Over 100
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
+ Carrying required
## General Explanation
This trick is used to multiply two numbers just over 100. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Compute the difference between the numbers and 100. Multiply them to get the last two digits of your final answer, and write them on the right side of the answer blank
2. Add these differences to 100. This will give you the first three digits of your answer, and carry if needed.
## Example 1
$$104\times 103=$$
1. The differences between these two numbers and 100 are 4 and 3. Multiply them together ($4\times 3=12$) and write the result (**12**)
2. Add these differences to 100 ($100+4+3=107$). Write this number to the left of the current answer (**10712**)
3. Final Answer: **10712**
## Example 2
$$112\times 109=$$
1. The differences between these two numbers and 100 are 12 and 9. Multiply them together ($12\times 9=108$), write the 08 on the right side of the answer blank, and carry the 1 (**08**)
2. Add these differences to 100 ($100+12+9=121$). Add the carry ($121+1=122$) Write this number to the left of the current answer (**12208**)
3. Final Answer: **12208**
