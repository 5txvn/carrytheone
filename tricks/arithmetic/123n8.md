## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The answer to multiplication problems of this form is simply $987\dots$, where the number of digits in the final answer is equal to n.
## Example 1
$$12345\times 8+5=$$
1. Since $n=5$, our final answer has 5 digits and is thus $98765$
2. Final Answer: **98765**
## Example 2
$$1234567\times 8+7=$$
1. Since $n=7$, our final answer has 7 digits and is thus $9876543$
2. Final Answer: **9876543**
