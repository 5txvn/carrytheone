# Multiplying Numbers Over and Under 100
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
## General Explanation
1. Compute the absolute difference between the numbers and 100. Multiply them, and subtract this result from 100 to get the last two digits of your final answer. Write them on the right side of the answer blank
2. Take the negative difference and subtract it from 99, then take the positive difference and add it to result. This will give you the first digits of your answer.
## Example 1
$$103\times 94=$$
1. The differences between these two numbers and 100 are 3 and 6. Multiply them together ($3\times 6=18$), subtract this number from 100 ($100-18=82$) and write the result (**82**)
2. Subtract the negative difference (6, since 94 is the number under 100) from 99 ($99-6=93$), and then add the positive difference (3) to this number ($93+3=96$). Write this result to the left of the current answer (**9682**)
3. Final Answer: **9682**
## Example 2
$$91\times 107=$$
1. The differences between these two numbers and 100 are 9 and 7. Multiply them together ($9\times 7=63$), subtract this number from 100 ($100-63=37$) and write the result (**37**)
2. Subtract the negative difference (9) from 99 ($99-9=90$), and then add the positive difference (7) to this number ($90+7=97$). Write this result to the left of the current answer (**9737**)
3. Final Answer: **9737**
