# 🔢
# $123\dots n\times 9+(n+1)$
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The answer to multiplication problems of this form is simply $111\dots$, where the number of digits in the final answer is equal to (n+1).
## Example 1
$$12345\times 8+6=$$
1. Since $n+1=6$, our final answer has 6 digits and is thus $111111$
2. Final Answer: **111111**
## Example 2
$$1234567\times 9+8=$$
1. Since $n+1=8$, our final answer has 8 digits and is thus $11111111$
2. Final Answer: **11111111**
