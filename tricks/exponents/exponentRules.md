## General Explanation
Oftentimes in algebra we deal with the manipulation of exponents. Number Sense is no exception to this, and thus, it's important to know the following 3 exponent rules to solve the below examples:
+ $x^a\cdot x^b=x^{a+b}$
+ $\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}$
+ $(x^a)^b=x^{ab}$

These rules are often used indirectly, so refer to the following problems to see some example usages.
## Example 1
*If $2^x=6$, then what is $2^{x+2}$*
1. Using exponent rules, we can simplify $2^{x+2}$ to be $2^x\cdot 2^2$
2. Since $2^x=6$, then $2^x\cdot 2^2=6\times 4=24$
3. Final Answer: **24**
## Example 2
*If $5^x=225$, then what is $5^{x-2}$*
1. Using exponent rules, we can simplify $5^{x-2}$ to be $\frac{5^x}{5^2}$
2. Since $5^x=225$, then $\frac{5^x}{5^2}=\frac{225}{25}=9$
3. Final Answer: **9**
## Example 3
*If $7^x=36$, then what is $7^{2x}$*
1. Using exponent rules, we can simplify $7^{2x}$ to be $(7^x)^2$
2. Since $7^x=36$, then $(7^x)^2=36^2=1296$
3. Final Answer: **1296**
