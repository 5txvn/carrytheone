# Squaring Numbers Ending in 5
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
## General Explanation
To square any number ending in 5, do the following:
1. Write 25 at the right side of the answer blank. Squaring any number that ends in 5 will always yield a result ending in 25.
2. Take the first digit and multiply it by 1 more than itself. This will comprise the first digits of the answer, so write it to the left of the 25.
## Example 1
$$85^2=$$
1. Write 25 on the right side of the answer blank (**25**)
2. Multiply the first digit (8) by 1 more than itself ($8\times (8+1)=72$). Write this number to the left of the 25 (**7225**)
3. Final Answer: **7225**
## Example 2
$$135^2=$$
1. Write 25 on the right side of the answer blank (**25**)
2. Multiply the first digit (13) by 1 more than itself ($13\times (13+1)=182$). Write this number to the left of the 25 (**18225**)
3. Final Answer: **18225**
