# Sum of Consecutive Squares
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
We can derive a formula for the sum of consecutive square numbers using some basic algebra:
1. First, represent this problem as $a^2+(a+1)^2$
2. Expand to get $a^2+(a+1)^2=a^2+a^2+2a+1=2a^2+2a+1$
3. Factor to get $2a^2+2a+1=2a(a+1)+1$

Thus, the sum of two consecutive squares is their product multiplied by 2 plus 1.
## Example 1
$$8^2+9^2=$$
1. Take the product of 8 and 9 to get 72 ($8\times 9=72$)
2. Multiply this result by 2 to get 144 ($72\times 2=144$)
3. Add 1 to get 145 ($144+1=145$)
4. Final Answer: **145**
## Example 2
$$16^2+17^2=$$
1. Take the product of 16 and 17 to get 272 ($16\times 17=272$)
2. Multiply this result by 2 to get 544 ($272\times 2=544$)
3. Add 1 to get 545 ($544+1=545$)
4. Final Answer: **545**
