# Difference of Consecutive Cubes
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Again, to derive a formula for the difference of consecutive cubes, we can use a bit of algebra:
1. Express the problem as $(a+1)^3-a^3$
2. Expand to get $(a+1)^3-a^3=a^3+3a^2+3a+1-a^3$ using binomial expansion
3. Combine like terms and factor to get $a^3+3a^2+3a+1-a^3=3a(a+1)+1$

Thus, the difference of two consecutive is simply the product of them times 3 plus 1.
## Example 1
$$9^3-8^3=$$
1. Take the product of 8 and 9 to get 72 ($8\times 9=72$)
2. Multiply this result by 3 to get 216 ($72\times 3=216$)
3. Add 1 to get 217 ($216+1=217$)
4. Final Answer: **217**
## Example 2
$$14^3-13^3=$$
1. Take the product of 13 and 14 to get 182 ($13\times 14=182$)
2. Multiply this result by 3 to get 546 ($182\times 3=546$)
3. Add 1 to get 547 ($546+1=547$)
4. Final Answer: **547**
