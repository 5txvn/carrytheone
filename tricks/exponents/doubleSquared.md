# $a^2+(2a)^2$
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
To derive a trick, we can use some simple algebra. Upon expanding the expression, we get $a^2+(2a)^2=a^2+4a^2=5a^2$. Thus, we can find $a^2+(2a)^2$ by simply squaring a, dividing it by 2, and then multiplying it by 10 ($5a^2=\frac{a^2}2\times 10$).
## Example 1
$$8^2+16^2=$$
1. Since $a=8$, square it to get $a^2=64$
2. Divide it by 2 to get 32 ($64\div 2=32$)
3. Multiply this result by 10 to get 320 ($32\times 10=320$)
4. Final Answer: **320**
## Example 2
$$13^2+26^2=$$
1. Since $a=13$, square it to get $a^2=169$
2. Divide it by 2 to get 84.5 ($169\div 2=84.5$)
3. Multiply this result by 10 to get 845 ($84.5\times 10=845$)
4. Final Answer: **845**
