# Sum of Fibonacci Sequence
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Fibonacci sequences are sequences in which every next term in the sequence is the sum of the previous two terms. Examples include:
+ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... (standard Fibonacci, notice how 3 is 1+2, 5 is +3, etc.)
+ 6, 7, 13, 20, 33, ...

Whenever you are asked to find the sum of a finite Fibonacci sequence on Number Sense tests, such a sum can easily be found using the formula $S=2F_n+F_{n-1}-F_2$, where $F_n$ is the last term of the sequence, $F_{n-1}$ is the second-to-last term, and $F_2$ is the second term.
## Example 1
$$1+1+2+3+\dots+21+34=$$
1. The last term of the sequence is $F_n=34$, the second-to-last is $F_{n-1}=21$, and the second is $F_2=1$. Thus, using the formula $S=2F_n+F_{n-1}-F_2$, the sum is $2\times 34+21-1=88$
2. Final Answer: **88**
## Example 2
$$4+2+6+8+\dots+94+152=$$
1. The last term of the sequence is $F_n=152$, the second-to-last is $F_{n-1}=94$, and the second is $F_2=2$. Thus, using the formula $S=2F_n+F_{n-1}-F_2$, the sum is $2\times 152+94-2=396$
2. Final Answer: **396**
