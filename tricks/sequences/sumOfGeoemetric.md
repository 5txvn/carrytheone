# Infinite Geometric Sums
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Geometric sequences are defined as sequences where, to get from one term to a successive term, you multiply by a certain number (commonly referred to as r). Examples include:
+ 1, 2, 4, 8, ... (r=2)
+ 1, $\frac 12$, $\frac 14$, $\frac 18$, ... (r=$\frac 12$)

Commonly on Number Sense tests, you will be asked to sum an infinite geometric series (only possible when the series is decreasing, or r<1). The sum of an infinite geometric series can be computed using the formula $S=\frac a{1-r}$, where a is the first term of the series.
## Example 1
$$3+2+1\frac 13+\frac 89+\dots=$$
1. The common ratio between terms in this sequence is $r=\frac 23$, and the first term is $a=3$. Thus, using the formula $S=\frac a{1-r}$, the sum is $S=\frac 3{1-\frac 23}=9$.
2. Final Answer: **9**
## Example 2
$$12+6+3+1\frac 12+\dots=$$
1. The common ratio between terms in this sequence is $r=\frac 12$, and the first term is $a=12$. Thus, using the formula $S=\frac a{1-r}$, the sum is $S=\frac 12{1-\frac 12}=24$.
2. Final Answer: **24**
