# Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The sum of any consecutive odd numbers beginning with 1 is simply $S=\left(\frac{n+1}2\right)^2$, where n is the last odd number in the sequence. If it's simpler to remember, this can be broken down into these steps:
1. Add 1 to the last number
2. Divide by 2
3. Square the result
## Example 1
$$1+3+5+\dots+19=$$
1. Add 1 to 19 ($19+1=20$)
2. Divide 20 by 2 ($20\div 2=10$)
3. Square 10 ($10^2=100$)
4. Final Answer: **100**
## Example 2
$$1+3+5+\dots+37=$$
1. Add 1 to 37 ($37+1=38$)
2. Divide 38 by 2 ($38\div 2=19$)
3. Square 19 ($19^2=361$)
4. Final Answer **361**
