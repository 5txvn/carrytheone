# Sum of Consecutive Even Numbers
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The sum of any consecutive even numbers beginning with 2 is simply $S=\left(\frac n2\right)\left(\frac n2+1\right)$, where n is the last even number in the sequence. If it's simpler to remember, this can be broken down into these steps:
1. Divide the last number by 2
2. Multiply the result by 1 more than itself
## Example 1
$$2+4+6+\dots+18=$$
1. Divide 18 by 2 ($18\div 2=9$)
2. Multiply 9 by 1 more than itself ($9\times 10=90$)
3. Final Answer: **90**
## Example 2
$$2+4+6+\dots+32=$$
1. Divide 32 by 2 ($32\div 2=16$)
2. Multiply 16 by 1 more than itself ($16\times 17=272$)
3. Final Answer: **272**
