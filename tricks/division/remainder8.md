# Remainder When Dividing By 8
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
This trick is almost exactly identitcal to the remainder when dividing by 4 trick, but instead of leaving only the last 2 digits, we leave the last 3 digits. This is because 100 is not divisible by 8, but 1000 is ($1000\div 8=125$).
## Example 1
*What is the remainder of $51834\div 8$?*
1. Remove all the digits except the last 3 to get 834
2. Divide 834 by 8 to get a remainder of 2 (this can be done easily since 800 is a multiple of 8, so just do 34 divided by 8)
3. Final Answer: **2**
## Example 2
*What is the remainder of $123456789\div 8$?*
1. Remove all the digits except the last 2 to get 789
2. Divide 789 by 8 to get a remainder of 5 (we know 720 is divisible by 8, so subtract 720 from 789 to get 69 divided by 8, much easier !!!)
3. Final Answer: **5**
## Video Explanation(s)
