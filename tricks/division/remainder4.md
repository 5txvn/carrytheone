# Remainder When Dividing By 4
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
Since we know that 100 is divisible by 4 ($100\div 4=25$), when finding the remainder when dividing a number by 4, we can omit all digits that represent place values of 100 or greater. In other words, cut all digits of the number besides the last 2, and find the remainder when you divide the last 2 by 4.
## Example 1
*What is the remainder of $51834\div 4$?*
1. Remove all the digits except the last 2 to get 34
2. Divide 34 by 4 to get a remainder of 2
3. Final Answer: **2**
## Example 2
*What is the remainder of $123456789\div 4$?*
1. Remove all the digits except the last 2 to get 89
2. Divide 89 by 4 to get a remainder of 1
3. Final Answer: **1**
