## General Explanation
When discussing polynomials, the term "roots" of a polynomial refers to the values of x which solve a polynomial (in other words, if you have a polynomial p(x) what values of x make p(x) equal zero). Assuming polynomials are expressed in the form $ax^n+bx^{n-1}+cx^{n-2}+\dots$, the sum of the roots of any polynomial is always equal to $-\frac ba$, or the negative of the second term's coefficient over the first term's coefficient (be careful though, because the value of b might be equal to zero for some polynomials!).
## Example 1
*Find the sum of the roots for $x^3+4x^2+5x+2$*
1. For this polynomial, $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, using the formula $-\frac ba$, the sum of the roots of this polynomial is $-\frac 41=-4$
2. Final Answer: **-4**
## Example 2
*Find the sum of the roots for $x^5+3x^3+4$*
1. This is a question where you need to be careful because b is actually equal to zero here, thus making the sum of the roots zero. The reason why b isn't equal to 3 is because the term that comes right after $x^5$ is $x^4$, and since there is no $x^4$ term, it is implied that its value is zero.
2. Final Answer: **0**
