# Remainder Theorem
## Notes
None.
## General Explanation
The remainder theorem is one that quite simply states "If a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x-a)$, then the remainder is $f(a)$." See the examples below for applications.
## Example 1
*Find the remainder when $f(x)=2x^3-x^2+5x-7$ is divided by $(x+1)*
1. Since $a=-1$, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x+1)$ is simply $f(-1)=2(-1)^3-(-1)^2+5(-1)-7=-15$
2. Final Answer: **-15**
## Example 2
*Find the remainder when $f(x)=x^3-4x+1$ is divided by $(x-2)*
1. Since $a=2$, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-2)$ is simply $f(2)=2^3-4\times 2+1=1$
2. Final Answer: **1**
## Video Explanation(s)
