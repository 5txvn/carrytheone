## General Explanation
The formula for the product of a polynomial's roots is quite similar to that for the sum. However, there is no generalized formula like $-\frac ba$ for the sum of the roots. Rather, the product of the roots is always the constant term (usually last term, but be careful, it can be zero!) of the polynomial over the coefficient of the first term (a). Additionally, the product can either be positive depending on the degree (highest exponent) of the polynomial. If the degree is even, the product is positive, and likewise for odd degrees.
## Example 1
*Find the product of the roots for $x^3+4x^2+5x+2$*
1. For this polynomial, the constant term is 2 and the coefficient of the first term ($x^3$) is 1. Thus, the product is $\frac 21=2$
2. Since the degree of the polynomial (3) is odd, the product will be negative
3. Final Answer: **-3**
## Example 2
*Find the sum of the roots for $3x^4+3x^3+4$*
1. For this polynomial, the constant term is 4 and the coefficient of the first term ($x^4$) is 3. Thus, the product is $\frac 43$
2. Since the degree of the polynomial (4) is even, the product will be positive
3. Final Answer: **$\frac 43$**
