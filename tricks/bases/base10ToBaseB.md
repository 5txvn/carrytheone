# Converting Base 10 to Base b
## Notes
+ Right-to-left trick
## General Explanation
1. Divide the number by b. Write the remainder on the right side of the answer blank.
2. Take the whole number portion of the division and divide it by b. Write it to the left of the current answer.
3. Continue this process until number cannot be further divided
## Example 1
$$194=\_\_\_\__5$$
1. Divide by 194 by 5 ($194\div 5=38\mathrm r4$). Write the 4 on the right side of the answer blank (**4**)
2. Divide 38 by 5 ($38\div 5=7\mathrm r3$). Write the 3 to the left of the current answer (**34**)
3. Divide 7 by 5 ($7\div 5=1\mathrm r2$). Write the 2 to the left of the current answer (**234**)
4. 1 cannot be further divided by 5, so write it to the left of the current answer (**1234**)
5. Final Answer: **1234**
## Example 2
$$276=\_\_\_\__7$$
1. Divide by 276 by 7 ($276\div 7=39\mathrm r3$). Write the 3 on the right side of the answer blank (**3**)
2. Divide 39 by 7 ($39\div 7=5\mathrm r4$). Write the 4 to the left of the current answer (**43**)
3. 5 cannot be further divided by 7, so write it to the left of the current answer (**543**)
4. Final Answer: **543**
