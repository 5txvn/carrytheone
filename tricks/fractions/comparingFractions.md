## General Explanation
Oftentimes in Number Sense you will be asked to determine if one fraction is larger/smaller than another. If you have not yet reviewed the butterfly method trick, please do so because we can simply compare fractions by determining which "antenna" of the butterfly has the larger value. For example, if you're trying to determine the larger fraction out of two given fractions, it will be the one with the larger-value antenna connecting to its numerator (in the below image, the larger fraction is $\frac 52$ because the products of the two antennae are 6 and 35, and the 35 antenna connects to the numerator of the $\frac 52$ fraction).

## Example 1
*Which is smaller, $\frac 25$ or $\frac 37$?*
1. We find the values of our two antennae to be 14 ($2\times 7=14$) and 15 ($3\times 5=15$) after cross-multiplying. Since the smaller antenna is 14 and it connects to the numerator of $\frac 25$, then $\frac 25$ is the smaller fraction.
2. Final Answer: **$\frac 25$**
## Example 2
*Which is larger, $-\frac 8{13}$ or $-\frac{10}{17}$?*
1. We find the values of our two antennae to be -136 ($-8\times 17=-136$) and -130 ($-10\times 13=-130$) after cross-multiplying. Since the larger/greater antenna is -130 and it connects to the numerator of $-\frac{10}{17}$, then $-\frac{10}{17}$ is the larger fraction.
2. Final Answer: **$-\frac{10}{17}$**
