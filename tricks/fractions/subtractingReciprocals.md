## General Explanation
In contrast to the derivation for adding the reciprocal of a fraction to itself, doing so with subtraction is rather simple:
1. Combine $\frac ab-\frac ba$ into one fraction using butterfly method to get $\frac{a^2-b^2}{ab}$
2. Using some basic algebra knowledge, we know that $a^2-b^2$ can be factored into $(a+b)(a-b)$. Thus, our final answer is quite simply $\frac{(a+b)(a-b)}{ab}$, or the sum of a and b times the difference of them over their product.

Again, make sure to check if your final answer is simplifiable or not!
## Example 1
$$\frac 89-\frac 98=$$
1. Take the sum of 8 and 9 ($8+9=17$) as well as the magnitude of their difference ($9-8=1$) and multiply them to get the numerator of our fraction ($17\times 1=17$).
2. Multiply 8 and 9 to get 72 ($8\times 9=72$). This is the denominator of our fraction.
3. Note that $\frac 89$ is smaller  than $\frac 98$. Since the larger fraction is being subtracted from the smaller fraction, our final answer will be **negative**.
4. Final Answer: **$-\frac{17}{72}$**
## Example 2
$$\frac{17}{13}-\frac{13}{17}=$$
1. Take the sum of 17 and 13 ($17+13=30$) as well as the magnitude of their difference ($17-13=4$) and multiply them to get the numerator of our fraction ($30\times 4=120$).
2. Multiply 17 and 13 to get 221 ($17\times 13=221$). This is the denominator of our fraction.
3. Since the smaller fraction is being subtracted from the larger fraction in this particular scenario, our final answer will remain **positive**.
4. Final Answer: **$\frac{120}{221}$**
