## General Explanation
Questions where you are asked to add a fraction and its reciprocal on Number Sense tests follow the form $\frac ab+\frac ba$. To derive a trick for these problems, we have to use a bit of algebra:
1. Combine them into one unified fraction using the butterfly method, which gives us $\frac ab+\frac ba=\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab}$
2. Rewrite the numerator to give us $\frac{a^2-2ab+b^2+2ab}{ab}$ (notice all we did was add and subtract 2ab from the numerator, you'll see why in just a second)
3. Notice that we can factor $a^2-2ab+b^2$ in the numerator! Doing this, we get $\frac{(a-b)^2+2ab}{ab}$
4. Split up the fraction and simplify to get a final reduced form of $\frac{(a-b)^2}{ab}+\frac{2ab}{ab}=2+\frac{(a-b)^2}{ab}$

As a quick summary, the result of $\frac ab+\frac ba$ will always be a mixed number with 2 as the whole number portion, and the fraction will have the difference of a and b squared as the numerator and their product as the denominator. Make sure to check if the fraction is simplifiable before writing it down!
## Example 1
$$\frac 89+\frac 98=$$
1. Take the difference of 8 and 9, then square it to get 1 ($(9-8)^2=1$). This is the numerator of our answer's fractional portion.
2. Multiply 8 and 9 to get 72 ($8\times 9=72$). This is the denominator of our answer's fractional portion.
3. Write down 2 as the whole number portion of our answer.
4. Final Answer: **$2 \frac 1{72}$**
## Example 2
$$\frac{13}{17}+\frac{17}{13}=$$
1. Take the difference of 17 and 13, then square it to get 16 ($(17-13)^2=16$). This is the numerator of our answer's fractional portion.
2. Multiply 17 and 13 to get 221 ($17\times 13=221$). This is the denominator of our answer's fractional portion.
3. Write down 2 as the whole number portion of our answer.
4. Final Answer: **$2 \frac 16{221}$**
