# $\frac 1a+\frac 1{2a}+\frac 1{4a}$
## Notes
+ Simplification required
## General Explanation
This particular kind of fraction addition problem is asked very frequently on Number Sense, and using a bit of algebra, we can discover that $\frac 1a+\frac 1{2a}+\frac 1{4a}$ is equal to $\frac{4}{4a}+\frac{2}{4a}+\frac 1{4a}=\frac 7{4a}$.
## Example 1
$$\frac 14+\frac 18+\frac 1{12}=$$
1. Since $4a=12$, our answer is simply $\frac 7{4a}=\frac 7{12}$
2. Final Answer: **$\frac 7{12}$**
## Example 2
$$\frac 75+\frac 7{10}+\frac 7{15}=$$
1. Since we have 7 in the numerators, we have to first pull out the 7 to make $7\left(\frac 15+\frac 1{10}+\frac 1{15}\right)$
2. Since $4a=15$, our answer is simply $7\left(\frac 7{15}\right)=\frac{49}{15}$
3. Final Answer: **$\frac{49}{15}$**
