# Butterfly Method
## Notes
+ Simplification required
## General Explanation
The butterfly method is a commonly used trick to add or subtract any two fractions. Typically when we learn to do so in elementary school, we are taught to find the least common denominator of both fractions, convert them to have that denominator, and simply add/subtract the numerators to achieve a final answer with this least common demoninator. This is certainly a viable method, but rather difficult to perform and keep track of mentally. Thus, we use the butterfly method, which effectively follows the same process but with the following steps:
1. Add/subtract the products of the antennae (refer to below image) to get the numerator of the final answer
2. Multiply denominators to get the denominator of the final answer
3. Simplify if necessary

## Example 1
$$\frac 25+\frac 37=$$
1. Multiply the two antennae to get 14 ($2\times 7=14$) and 15 ($3\times 5=15$). Add them together to get 29, the numerator of our final answer.
2. Multiply the two denominators to get 35 ($5\times 7=35$), the denominator of our final answer.
3. Check for simplification. In this case, $\frac{29}{35}$ cannot be simplified.
4. Final Answer: **$\frac{29}{35}$**
## Example 2
$$\frac 87-\frac 49=$$
1. Multiply the two antennae to get 72 ($8\times 9=72$) and 28 ($7\times 4=28$). Using the image above, we subtract the blue antenna from the red antenna, so the numerator of our final answer is 44 ($72-28=44$).
2. Multiply the two denominators to get 63 ($7\times 9=63$), the denominator of our final answer.
3. Check for simplification. In this case, $\frac{44}{63}$ cannot be simplified.
4. Final Answer: **$\frac{44}{63}$**
